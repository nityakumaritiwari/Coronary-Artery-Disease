# Coronary-Artery-Disease
This is deep learning based project. In this project I have used Coronary Artery Disease dataset from Kaggle. There were  127  normal   and  78  abnormal images. Then I have applied 
normalization and then augmentation. After augmentation I have applied two deep learning models Vgg16+ Densenet201, which then further gets merged to produce .csv file .
Then i have used various classifiers to detect the performance of the model, Best result were:-
Decision Tree-100%  (best result)
Logistic regression-81%
